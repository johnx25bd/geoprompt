# GeoPrompt: Natural Language Interface for Geospatial Databases

~In development~

**GeoPrompt** is a simple yet powerful tool that allows anyone to interact with geospatial databases using natural language. Whether you're a map enthusiast, a researcher, or just curious about the world, GeoPrompt makes it easy to ask questions and see the answers visualized on a map.

### **How It Works**

1. **Ask a Question:** Type your query into the chatbox, like “Show me all the parks in Paris.”

3. **Visualize It:** See the results instantly on an interactive map.

### **Why Use GeoPrompt?**

- **Simple:** No technical knowledge needed—just ask in plain language.
- **Interactive:** Explore the results directly on a map.
- **Efficient:** Access complex geospatial insights without writing code.
