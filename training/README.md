# Geoprompt: Experiments for Prompt Engineering 

We built the prompts for this project iteratively, by running experiments on the dataset, examining results, and then refining the prompts. The prompt itself is stored in [`gpt-prompt.md`](./gpt-prompt.md)

The prompts use to assess the quality of query responses are stored in [`experiment-prompts.json`](./experiment-prompts.json). The results of the experiments are stored in [`experiments/`](./experiments/)

We committed updates to prompts, gpt.py etc with each experiment loop:
1. [Commit `4d013c3`](https://github.com/johnx25bd/geoprompt/commit/4d013c3e8e1e0808024c9837046280ae6f06d7e8)
2. [Commit `d965efd`](https://github.com/johnx25bd/geoprompt/commit/d965efda34b01662ada272083ee6a2f5fa974b94)
3. Commit `369bdcb`

We took notes on the experimental process, you can see those in Notion [here](https://x25bd.notion.site/Geoprompt-Experiments-1531e77be9f280a0b48ce05ec439c3a7?pvs=4).

There is a lot of opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency of the product, this is just a glimpse into the process we used in prompt engineering for this prototype.
